== Description ==

This plugin is mainly for programmers to use. It contains an options page to set up a connection to a Google account, and allows you to choose a Google Cloud Print printer from your account and to test printing to it.

The main use of this plugin is for developers of other plugins to deploy, and integrate with their plugins. For example, I have developed a plugin that can send orders from a web shop automatically to Google Cloud Print.

= How can a developer use it? =

Here's some example code:

`// Ensure that we can get a Google Cloud Print Library object

if (class_exists('GoogleCloudPrintLibrary_GCPL_v2')) {

	// The first parameter to print_document() is the printer ID. Use false to send to the default. You can use the get_printers() method to get a list of those available.

	$gcpl = new GoogleCloudPrintLibrary_GCPL_v2();

	$printed = $gcpl->print_document(false, get_bloginfo('name').' - test print', '<b>My HTML to print</b>');

	// Parse the results
	if (!isset($printed->success)) {
		trigger_error('Unknown response received from GoogleCloudPrintLibrary_GCPL->print_document()', E_USER_NOTICE);
	} elseif ($printed->success !== true) {
		trigger_error('GoogleCloudPrintLibrary_GCPL->print_document(): printing failed: '.$printed->message, E_USER_NOTICE);
	}

}`

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What does this plugin do? =

It is a developers' plugin. It provides code to get you connected quickly and easily to Google Cloud Print. A developer can harness it rapidly from within his own plugin to despatch print jobs to a Google Cloud Print-connected printer.

= How do I, as a developer, use it? =

Please see the plugin description.

= Please will you add a new feature? =

Only upon commission. This plugin does what I need - I am sharing it with the community, but not intending to develop it further unless I personally need to. I am happy to accept patches for improvements from the community.

= What support is provided for this plugin? =

None from me. I will accept useful patches that make this plugin more useful for others - please email them to david at wordshell dot net. This plugin is by a developer, for developers. To understand more of how it works beyond the description here, please read the (short, simple) code.

= Got any other interesting tools? =

Please check out the very popular UpdraftPlus backup plugin (http://updraftplus.com), my profile page (http://profiles.wordpress.org/DavidAnderson), and for command-line users, WordShell (http://wordshell.net).
